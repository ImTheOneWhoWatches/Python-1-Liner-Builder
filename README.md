Python One-Liner Builder
============================
Python One-Line Builder is a tool designed to transform any Python script into a one-liner executable command. This tool encrypts the script, embeds the decryption key, and generates a compact one-liner that installs required dependencies, decrypts, and executes the script.

Features
 * Script Encryption: Encrypts Python scripts using the cryptography library.
 * One-Liner Generation: Produces a single Python command that installs dependencies and executes the encrypted script.
 * File Picker Integration: Built-in file picker to easily select scripts for processing.
 * Save to File: Saves the generated one-liner to a new Python file.
Requirements
 * Python 3.x
 * cryptography library
 * tkinter for the file picker
Installation
 * Download the zip

The tool will:

Encrypt the script.
Generate a one-liner command.
Save the one-liner to a file named one_liner.py in the same directory as the builder.
Execute the generated one_liner.py as a standalone script.
